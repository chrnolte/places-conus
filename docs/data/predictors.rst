Predictors
==========

This is the list of :ref:`parcel <Parcels>`-level **predictors** and **filter variables** for our :ref:`models <Models>` of fair market value (FMV).

Most predictors are derived from geospatial :ref:`parcel boundaries <Parcels>` and publicly available geodata. A few are imported directly from:

* :any:`Parcels` (geolocation: :any:`x`, :any:`y`, size: :any:`ha`).
* :any:`Transactions` (:any:`date`)

:ref:`Models` are trained on different *combinations* of these predictors (:ref:`predictor sets <Predictor sets>`). 

For a full list of variables, see the `PLACES variable dictionary <https://placeslab.org/dictionary/>`_.

Buildings
*********

All of the following indicators are derived from Microsoftâ€™s open-source `USBuildingFootprints <https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints>`_ dataset, which contains polygons of 125.2 million buildings inferred from high-resolution satellite imagery with neural networks.

:Access: `<https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints>`_
:Accessed: Aug 21, 2023

Microsoft's building footprints are our preferred open-source metric for the **presence of buildings** in CONUS, as they are more consistently available across CONUS than other indicators (e.g., tax assessor data). However, building footprints introduce new sources of error. For instance, footprints under trees are often missed.

Alternative measures of building presence are available in tax assessor and parcel boundary datasets. However, their availability and quality varies across states and counties. For a comparison of ZTRAX-based and remote-sensing based building variables see `Nolte et al. (2023) Land Economics <https://le.uwpress.org/content/early/2023/06/09/le.100.1.102122-0090R>`_ (Appendix Figures A14-16)
