Overview
========

PLACES-FMV (CONUS) data are **estimates** of fair market value and of uncertainties.

Each estimate is the product of a model specification. Each model specification is a combination of:

* :ref:`Submarkets` in which the model was trained.
* :ref:`Estimators` that were used.
* a ``feature set`` (:math:`X`) used in training.
