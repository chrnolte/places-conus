PLACES
======

The `Private-Land Conservation Evidence System <https://placeslab.org/places/>`_ (PLACES) is a data synthesis platform for parcel data in the contiguous United States (CONUS).

PLACES links geo-located property boundaries to tax roll data and many social and environmental variables from public sources and Earth observation satellites.

PLACES contains (some) data on ownership, buildings, sales, protection investments, infrastructure, demographics, geophysical characteristics, long-term land cover change, and other variables for more than 130 million parcels in more than 2,700 counties.

It builds upon an extensive open-source ecosystem, leaning heavily on `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_, `geopandas <https://geopandas.org/en/stable/>`_, and `OSGeo <https://www.osgeo.org/>`_.

Boston University's version is deployed on the `Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center <https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/rcs/mghpcc/>`_.

PLACES data has been used in more than a dozen peer-reviewed high-dimensional empirical analyses in the realm of conservation effectiveness, environmental policy, and environmental economics: `list of publications <https://placeslab.org/publications/>`_.
