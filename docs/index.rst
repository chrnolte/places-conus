This is the **documentation** and **user's guide** for the PLACES-FMV (CONUS) data release.

PLACES-FMV (CONUS) is a set of parcel-level estimates of the **fair market value (FMV) of vacant lands** in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The estimates are derived statistically from data on 1.3 million vacant land sales (2000-2021) using an ensemble of simple, scalable, locally responsive predictive model specifications.

Government, academic, and non-profit analysts will be able to access the data volume at no cost through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (`ICPSR <https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/>`_). The planned release date is Jun 30, 2023; early adopters can join by Jan 15, 2023.

The research is conducted at Boston University's `PLACES lab <https://placeslab.org>`_ [#f1]_ and supported by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences program [#f2]_.
