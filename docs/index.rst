PLACES-FMV (CONUS)
==================

.. warning::
   Welcome to the documentation of PLACES-FMV (CONUS). Thank you for your interest. As you discover, keep in mind that this is a draft (**beta**) document. Its purpose is to facilitate communications with the research team, collaborator panel, data partners, and early adopters. Please report errors to `chrnolte@bu.edu <mailto:chrnolte@bu.edu>`_. Get updates on Github: `<https://github.com/chrnolte/places-conus>`_

.. important::
   A data volume from public sources has been shared with early adopters. It inherits the **data use licenses** from the most conservative of its input sources (see :ref:`Data`). We are working on an agreement that allows us to share the data volume at no cost with government, academic, and non-profit analysts through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (`ICPSR <https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/>`_).

.. important::
   * Jul 19 - 20, 2023: data release webinar
   * Aug 4, 2023: deadline for suggestion of additional models
   * Sep 30, 2023: our research team has to delete all training data (hard deadline).

This is the **documentation** and **user's guide** for the PLACES-FMV (CONUS) data release.

PLACES-FMV (CONUS) is a data volume of parcel-level estimates of the **fair market value (FMV) of vacant lands** in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The estimates are derived statistically from training data of millions of vacant and "mostly" vacant land sales (2000-2021). Our statistical :ref:`Models` are relatively simple, scalable, and fit at different geographic levels (county, region, state, CONUS).

The research is conducted at Boston University's `PLACES lab <https://placeslab.org>`_ and supported by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences program [#f1]_.

   Data for the first phase of this research (Aug 1, 2022 - Sep 30, 2023) provided by `Zillow <https://www.zillowgroup.com/>`_ through the Zillow Transaction and Assessment Dataset (ZTRAX). More information can be found at `<http://www.zillow.com/ztrax>`_. The results and opinions are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the position of Zillow Group.

.. note::
   We thank Regrid's `Data with Purpose <https://regrid.com/purpose>`_ program, which provides access to nonprofit researchers on a "pay what you can" basis. For two thirds of CONUS counties, PLACES-FMV (CONUS) is based on Regrid parcel data. For the remaining counties, parcel boundary data was downloaded from publicly available sources.

.. important::
   While we have produced this data volume in good faith, it does not come with any legal warranties and with no formal guarantees. Human errors in data entry, processing, and interpretation are bound to happen in a project that synthesizes and interpretes governmental and satellite data over such a vast and diverse continent.
