Data access
===========

Government, academics, and non-profit users will be able to access the data volume at no cost through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (`ICPSR <https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/>`_).

The release is planned for Spring 2024.

Early adopters
**************

Prior to the ICPSR release, we invite **“early adopters”** to scrutinize and improve our data and models.

Participants receive access to preliminary versions of the data volume, documentation, and code, as well as training on how to interpret and use the data for their analyses. In exchange, they scrutinize the published research products and documentation and offer feedback.

Please feel free to reach out `chrnolte@bu.edu <mailto:chrnolte@bu.edu>`_ if you:

1. have a vested interest in the accuracy of parcel-level estimates of FMV and protection cost used in spatial planning (and ideally expertise to contribute)
2. have the computational skills to process tabular and spatial datasets, as well as sufficient statistical training to interpret regressions and metrics of statistical significance and uncertainty, and
3. are employed by a U.S. academic institution, government agency, or a non-profit. We hope to attract a group with diverse backgrounds and interests.
