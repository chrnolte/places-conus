*********
Buildings
*********

All of the following indicators are derived from Microsoftâ€™s open-source `USBuildingFootprints <https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints>`_ dataset, which contains polygons of 125.2 million buildings inferred from high-resolution satellite imagery with neural networks.

:Access: `<https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints>`_
:Accessed: Dec 6, 2019

.. important::

   Microsoft's building footprints are our preferred open-source metric for the **presence of buildings** in CONUS, as they are more broadly and consistently available than other indicators (e.g., tax assessor data). However, the use of building footprints can introduce its own sources of error. For instance, footprints under trees are often missed. For more information, please refer to the `USBuildingFootprints documentation on Github <https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints>`_

   Alternative measures of building presence are available in tax assessor and parcel boundary datasets, but usually not consistent across states and counties. For a comparison of indicators of CONUS-wide building presence, see `Nolte et al. (2021) <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3900806>`_ (Figure S14).


.. attribute:: n_bld_fp

   Count of Microsoft building footprints on the parcel.

   :Geoprocessing: polygon intersections.

.. attribute:: p_bld_fp

   Percentage (0-100) of the area of the parcel that is covered by Microsoft building footprints.

   :Geoprocessing: polygon intersections.

.. aluna:aluna:: p_bld_fp_<radius>

   Percentage of area within the given ``radius`` (integer, meters) that is covered by building footprints. An indicator of nearby building density.

   :Geoprocessing: rasterization of building footprints, pixel-based computation of average building footprint presence within circular neighborhood (2D convolution with moving-window kernel), averaged across all pixels within each parcel (zonal statistics).
