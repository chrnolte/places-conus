Overview
========

PLACES-FMV (CONUS) data are parcel-level **estimates** of fair market value (FMV) and associated uncertainties.

The :any:`Estimation` component develops these estimates from data on private land transactions. All estimates are predictions from :ref:`Models`. These models are trained in :ref:`Submarkets` (geographies) using statistical :ref:`Estimators` with specific :ref:`Predictor sets`.

The :any:`Validation` component tests the predictive accuracy of the FMV estimates in estimating the cost of public land acquisitions and conservation easements in CONUS. We will collect a validation sample from public transactions.
