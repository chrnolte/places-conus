PLACES-FMV (CONUS) is a set of parcel-level estimates of the **fair market value (FMV) of vacant lands** in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The estimates are derived statistically from data of millions of vacant land sales between 2000-2021, using an ensemble of regression estimators (multilinear, tree ensembles) at multiple spatial scales.

Government, academic, and non-profit analysts will be able to access the data volume at no cost through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (`ICPSR <https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/>`_). A group of :ref:`Early adopters` from academic, governmental, and non-profit organizations is currently scrutinizing early versions of the dataset prior to public release.

The 2020s have seen new investments into multi-level, multi-regional conservation planning efforts in the United States. In the midst of the Covid pandemic, the `Great American Outdoors Act <https://www.doi.gov/gaoa>`_ generated the largest-ever federal budget for public investments into long-term land protection. Shortly after, the incoming Biden administration launched the "`America The Beautiful <https://www.doi.gov/priorities/america-the-beautiful>`_" initiative, a call to action to work together to conserve, connect, and restore 30 percent of U.S. lands and water by 2030 ("30 by 30").

Increasing land protection can have many public benefits, including forest carbon storage, wildlife conservation, flood risk adaptation, protection of exurban farmland, and equitable access to open space and urban parks. It often involves substantial public expenses for purchases of land rights through land acquisitions and conservation easements. Understanding the benefits and costs of potential transactions can shed new light on preferences in public choices, enhance transparency, and contribute to the long-term cost-effectiveness of public investment portfolios.
