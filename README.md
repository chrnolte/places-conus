### Land value models and estimates for the contiguous United States

**Documentation**: https://places-conus.readthedocs.io/en/latest

This repository documents the data, methods, and code to use and reproduce statistical models and parcel-level estimates of the **fair market value (FMV) of land** for vacant parcels in the contiguous United States (CONUS) with accuracy metrics.

This is active research (2022-2026), funded by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences (HEGS) program (award [#2149243](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2149243)).

*The first phase of this research (Aug 1, 2022 - Sep 30, 2023) is made possible by Zillow Group, Inc, a U.S. real estate company, that gave academics, governments, and non-profits free access to its Transaction and Assessment Dataset (ZTRAX) (large-scale tax assessor and sales data) between 2016 and Sep 30, 2023 (http://www.zillow.com/ztrax). The results and opinions are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the position of Zillow Group.*

*"PLACES" is the "Private-Land Conservation Evidence System" a software that aggregates high-dimensional parcel data across large scales (currently CONUS) to study the dynamics, cost, and impact of land conservation initiatives. It is developed and maintained at Boston University and it's source code will be published here upon conclusion of the research.*
