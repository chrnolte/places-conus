Estimates from each model, with associated prediction uncertainties, and indicators of statistical support.

Linking PLACES-FMV estimates to parcel polygons

We will make a Python algorithm available that generates a unique parcel identifier from the parcel polygon. This should allow you to link up the data.

..note::

  There has to be a perfect match in the geospatial polygons.
