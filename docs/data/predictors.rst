Predictors
==========

This is the list of **parcel-level predictors** and **filter variables** for our :ref:`Models` of fair market value (FMV).

These predictors are derived from geo-located :ref:`parcel boundaries <Parcels>` and publicly available geo-spatial datasets. The spatial resolution of the input data varies: from large ZIP codes to finely digitized river bends down to building footprints and 10m pixels. Geoprocessing steps vary - from simple spatial joins to estimating road access or lake frontage along a property line - and are provided below.

:ref:`Models` are trained on different *combinations* of these predictors (:ref:`Predictor sets`). Predictor sets also include data from :any:`Transactions` (notably :any:`date`) and from :any:`Parcels` (geolocation: :any:`x`, :any:`y`; and size: :any:`ha`).

For a full list of variables, see the `PLACES variable dictionary <https://placeslab.org/dictionary/>`_.

*********
Buildings
*********

All of the following indicators are derived from Microsoftâ€™s open-source `USBuildingFootprints <https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints>`_ dataset, which contains polygons of 125.2 million buildings inferred from high-resolution satellite imagery with neural networks.

:Access: `<https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints>`_
:Accessed: Dec 6, 2019

Microsoft's building footprints are our preferred open-source metric for the **presence of buildings** in CONUS, as they are more consistently available across CONUS than other indicators (e.g., tax assessor data). However, building footprints introduce new sources of error. For instance, footprints under trees are often missed.

Alternative measures of building presence are available in tax assessor and parcel boundary datasets. However, their availability and quality varies across states and counties. For a comparison of ZTRAX-based and remote-sensing based building variables see `Nolte et al. (2023) Land Economics <https://le.uwpress.org/content/early/2023/06/09/le.100.1.102122-0090R>`_ (Appendix Figures A14-16)

   :Geoprocessing: polygon intersections.

.. attribute:: p_bld_fp

.. aluna:aluna:: p_bld_fp_*

*************
Spatial units
*************

Spatial reference units, ordered from those with few units (U.S. states) to those with many (census block groups).

.. attribute:: division

   U.S. census division (groups of `state`)

.. attribute:: state

   U.S. state, identified by its two-letter Alpha code (e.g. ``CA`` for California)

.. attribute:: region_id

   Region identifier.

   :any:`Core-based regions` are an experimental geographic identifier developed at the :any:`PLACES` lab. Regions divide the contiguous U.S. into less than 1000 spatial units that are identified by their high-value "core" (city centers, resorts).

   We prefer modeling at the level of regions rather than counties or states, as the latter vary substantially in size and number across the U.S. geography.
