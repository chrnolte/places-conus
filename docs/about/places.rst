PLACES
======

The `Private-Land Conservation Evidence System <https://placeslab.org/places/>`_ (PLACES) is a data synthesis platform for parcel data in the contiguous United States (CONUS).

PLACES connects geographic data on :ref:`Parcel boundaries`, :ref:`Tax assessor records`, and :ref:`Transactions` (such as deeds). Parcel boundaries permit inference on the characteristics of the land, buildings, landowner choices, and local demographics (:ref:`Predictors`) from public data sources and Earth observation satellites. We use these rich datasets to explore a variety of questions of interest to policy makers and conservation planners.

PLACES contains (some) data on ownership, buildings, sales, protection investments, infrastructure, demographics, geophysical characteristics, long-term land cover change, and other variables for more than 130 million parcels in more than 2,700 counties.

The software is built on top of Python's extensive open-source ecosystem: `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_, `geopandas <https://geopandas.org/en/stable/>`_, `OSGeo <https://www.osgeo.org/>`_, and `QGIS <https://qgis.org/en/site/>`_.

Boston University's PLACES instance is deployed on the `Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center <https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/rcs/mghpcc/>`_.

PLACES data has been used in more than a dozen peer-reviewed empirical analyses in the realm of conservation effectiveness, environmental policy, and environmental economics: `list of publications <https://placeslab.org/publications/>`_.
