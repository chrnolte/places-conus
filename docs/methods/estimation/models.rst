Models
======

Models are statistical objects that can be fitted ("trained") to empirical data (here: land sales) to make predictions about the expected values of previously unobserved transactions (here: hypothetical sales of any parcel).

PLACES-FMV (CONUS) models are defined by:

* The :any:`Submarkets` for which they observe sales and make predictions.
* The statistical :any:`Estimators` they use.
* The :any:`Feature sets` they see.
