Data access
===========

Government, academics, and non-profit users will be able to access the data volume at no cost through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (`ICPSR <https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/>`_). The planned release date is Jun 30, 2023. More information on access will be posted here as soon as it becomes available.

Early adopters
**************

Prior to the ICPSR release, we invite **“early adopters”** to scrutinize and improve our data and models. Participants receive access to preliminary versions of the data volume, documentation, and code, as well as training on how to interpret and use the data for their analyses. In exchange, they scrutinize the published research products, offer feedback on its perceived accuracy and utility, and suggest improvements. The exchange occurs over monthly virtual meetings between January and June 2023.

We encourage applications from analysts who:

1. have a vested interest in the accuracy of parcel-level estimates of FMV and protection cost used in spatial planning (and ideally expertise to contribute)
2. have the computational skills to process tabular and spatial datasets, as well as sufficient statistical training to interpret regressions and metrics of statistical significance and uncertainty, and
3. are employed by a U.S. academic institution, government agency, or other non-profits. We hope to attract a group with diverse backgrounds and interests.

If interested and eligible, please send a short email to `chrnolte@bu.edu <mailto:chrnolte@bu.edu>`_ that signals your fit with criteria 1-3. Include the word “early adopter” in the email title, to help us hedge against overzealous spam filters.
