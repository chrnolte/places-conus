PLACES-FMV (CONUS) is a set of parcel-level estimates of the **fair market value (FMV) of vacant lands** in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The estimates are derived statistically from data on 1.3 million vacant land sales (2000-2021) using an ensemble of simple, scalable, locally responsive predictive model specifications.

Government, academic, and non-profit analysts will be able to access the data volume at no cost through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (`ICPSR <https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/>`_). The planned release date is Jun 30, 2023.

Recent years have seen a revitalization of inclusive, multi-level, and multi-regional conservation planning efforts, currently often in the context of the "`America The Beautiful <https://www.doi.gov/priorities/america-the-beautiful>`_" initiative. Created by President Bidenâ€™s Executive Order 14008 "Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad", the federal initiative is a call to action to work together to conserve, connect, and restore 30 percent of U.S. lands and water by 2030. Increasing land protection can enhance public goods, including forest carbon storage, wildlife conservation, flood risk adaptation, protection of exurban farmland, and equitable access to open space and urban parks. It also often involves substantial public expenses, e.g. for voluntary acquisitions of land rights. Integrating both into public planning process can clarify conservation goals and enhance the effectiveness of public investments.

The research is supported by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences (HEGS) program (grant `#2149243 <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2149243>`_) and implemented by Boston University's `PLACES lab <https://placeslab.org>`_.
