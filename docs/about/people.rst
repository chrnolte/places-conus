PLACES-FMV (CONUS) is a set of parcel-level estimates of the **fair market value (FMV) of vacant lands** in the contiguous United States (CONUS). The estimates are derived statistically from data on 1.3 million vacant land sales (2000-2021) using an ensemble of simple and scalable predictive models.
